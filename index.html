            <p>Much obliged you hopped on over.</p>
            <p>This here is a small site that highlights my time in high school.
                I have had many amazing people to share the experience with.
                 Alright, let's get into it!

                    Small Sadie attending her first high school dance <i>ever,</i> accompanied 
                    by two of her good buddies Ivy (middle) + Sarah (right). While I apparently
                    couldn't be bothered to look at the camera, we all unintentionally matched
                    w/ floral!

                    this is my favorite photo I took for my senior hoco. Pictured top right in the magnificent
                    green is Maia and right beneath her in the glorious purple is Ivy.

                    While I'm not quite sure how Halloween managed to get an exclusive category in the web
                    montage of my high school life, I managed to have some pretty rad Halloween celebrations
                    in high school. Pictured on the left is Min, our 10th grade foreign exchange student from
                    South Korea dressed as Little Red Riding Hood. In the middle is Sarah rocking a homemade
                    Princess Zelda costume. And I'm on the right with my $10 Donatello TMNT costume.

                    Oh dear, this sure is a special one. In junior year, I had the privilege to go trick-or-treating 
                    with Elsa! Well, it was actually Caleb but he was just as cool if you catch my drift. Pictured on
                    the right is me in an oversized costume. And yes, I did attend Cross Country practice with the full 
                    suit on.

                    Yet another epic Halloween this past year. I got to spend it w/ Brynn (left) as Eleven from
                    Stranger Things, Sarah (middle) as, and Ivy (right) as the Miraculous Lady Bug. Dressed with another
                    $10 steal from the local Halloween Superstore, I went as Rey from Star Wars.

                This entire section is what I like to call: "It's just a Cross Country thing." 
                Pictured here is our Coach Ruben collecting our phones on our way down to States to ensue
                some quality bonding time. You can see the devilish smile on his face that knows we will 
                be forced to converse with one another. My, I never heard of such a thing.

                These two photos were taken during Cross Country camp, which is a whole other thing in itself.
                Both pictured are in the middle of intense games. The first being 4-square: a common activity
                enjoyed at camp inbetween the grueling runs. And second, a battle between the hook-things that
                help you not die on rope courses.

                I'd like to call this one "It's just a Cross Country thing 2.0" After our last conference
                race of the season, we made our way to grocery store to carbload on ice cream + pizza.

                This was taken the same day as the above photo. We squished in our cars and devoured
                the aforementioned pizza much to our delights. Judy is pictured in the middle with the 
                huge grin on her face, with Maia on the right.

                While it's not exactly Cross Country, it's still running, so same thing, right? During an
                off-season run through the snow, Robbie (left) is having a grand ol' time, while Bill (middle)
                and I are struggling a bit, though I don't think you can tell that by the big smile on his face. 
                Note the matching Ellsworth sweatpants (I was wearing mine too.)

                Let's change gears to the <i>other</i> running sport I do, Track & Field, and appreciate
                this very wholesome photo of me and my friend, Brooke. It seems we just finished a relay,
                given the silver baton in my hand.

                On a Washington D.C. school field trip, I'm sitting on a fountain with my considerably
