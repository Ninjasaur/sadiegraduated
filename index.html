            <p>Much obliged you hopped on over.</p>
            <p>This here is a small site that highlights my time in high school.
                I have had many amazing people to share the experience with.
                 Alright, let's get into it!

                    by two of her good buddies Ivy (middle) + Sarah (right). While I apparently
                    couldn't be bothered to look at the camera, we all unintentionally matched
                    w/ floral!

                    this is my favorite photo I took for my senior hoco. Pictured top right in the magnificent

                    montage of my high school life, I managed to have some pretty rad Halloween celebrations
                    in high school. Pictured on the left is Min, our 10th grade foreign exchange student from
                    South Korea dressed as Little Red Riding Hood. In the middle is Sarah rocking a homemade
                    Princess Zelda costume. And I'm on the right with my $10 Donatello TMNT costume.

                    Oh dear, this sure is a special one. In junior year, I had the privilege to go trick-or-treating 
                    with Elsa! Well, it was actually Caleb but he was just as cool if you catch my drift. Pictured on
                    the right is me in an oversized costume. And yes, I did attend Cross Country practice with the full 
                    suit on.

                This entire section is what I like to call: "It's just a Cross Country thing." 
                Pictured here is our Coach Ruben collecting our phones on our way down to States to ensue
                some quality bonding time. You can see the devilish smile on his face that knows we will 
                be forced to converse with one another. My, I never heard of such a thing.

                I'd like to call this one "It's just a Cross Country thing 2.0" After our last conference
                race of the season, we made our way to grocery store to carbload on ice cream + pizza.

                the aforementioned pizza much to our delights. Judy is pictured in the middle with the

                and I are struggling a bit, though I don't think you can tell that by the big smile on his face.

                this very wholesome photo of me and my friend, Brooke. It seems we just finished a relay,

                Here's another thing I made! Probably being the art piece that I am most proud of, I had to
                customize a color wheel with primary and secondary colors. So, I chose a pie. Pies and wheels
                are pretty much the same thing, being circles and all, right?

                my vehicle, I had a heart attack that someone had stolen both my stickers + license plate (shh,
                I promise I can think properly some of the time.) But anyways, there just happened to be two lil'
                Fits right next to each other.

                While they're a lot to keep up with, it was a nice change to have, though maybe not right in 
                the middle of the Cross Country season.
