            <p>I've created this website to highlight my time in high school. While that phase of my life has come
                to an end, I'm onto my next at the University of Michigan for Computer Science (maybe). <br>

                    South Korea dressed as Little Red Riding Hood. In the middle is Sarah rocking a homemade
