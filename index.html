            <p>Much obliged you hopped on over.</p>
            <p>This here is a small site that highlights my time in high school.
                I have had many amazing people to share the experience with.
                 Alright, let's get into it!

                    Small Sadie attending her first high school dance <i>ever,</i> accompanied 
                    by two of her good buddies Ivy (middle) + Sarah (right). While I apparently
                    couldn't be bothered to look at the camera, we all unintentionally matched
                    w/ floral!

                    Enough pictures of me in dresses, look at my friends! Taken atop Brooke's (left) stairs,
                    this is my favorite photo I took for my senior hoco. Pictured top right in the magnificent
                    green is Maia and right beneath her in the glorious purple is Ivy.

                    While I'm not quite sure how Halloween managed to get an exclusive category in the web
                    montage of my high school life, I managed to have some pretty rad Halloween celebrations
                    in high school. Pictured on the left is Min, our 10th grade foreign exchange student from
                    South Korea dressed as Little Red Riding Hood. In the middle is Sarah rocking a homemade
                    Princess Zelda costume. And I'm on the right with my $10 Donatello TMNT costume.

                    Oh dear, this sure is a special one. In junior year, I had the privilege to go trick-or-treating 
                    with Elsa! Well, it was actually Caleb but he was just as cool if you catch my drift. Pictured on
                    the right is me in an oversized costume. And yes, I did attend Cross Country practice with the full 
                    suit on.

                    Yet another epic Halloween this past year. I got to spend it w/ Brynn (left) as Eleven from
                    Stranger Things, Sarah (middle) as, and Ivy (right) as the Miraculous Lady Bug. Dressed with another
                    $10 steal from the local Halloween Superstore, I went as Rey from Star Wars.
